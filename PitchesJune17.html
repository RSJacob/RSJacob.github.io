<h2>Where are the ABA practitioners?</h2>
<p>Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is one of the few empirically supported interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It can be an incredibly useful tool, particularly for parents struggling to manage their children's problem behaviors. Anecdotally, I've noticed that there are great disparities in access to ABA providers across the U.S., seemingly independent of access to healthcare services in general. Autism Speaks hosts a list of the registered ABA providers in each state, which I propose to map and compare with a number of other statistics related to autism spectrum disorders, such as: </p>
	<ul><li>Number of children diagnosed with ASD per capita (does it fluctuate?)</li>
		<li>Number and type of available therapies through school systems</li>
		<li>Popular insurance plans in each state, and whether ABA is covered</li>
		<li>Age of diagnosis per state (if I can find this, it might be interesting to look at the lag times)</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Literacy rate and number of siblings</h2>

<p>Do world literacy rates vary with the average number of children per household? It seems logical to assume that the more children a family has, the less likely all of them will be able to complete their education. WHO and the Kaiser Family Foundation have datasets that I can use to compare these statistics over time. A cursory examination reveals that while this may be the general trend, it is not a hard rule -- which prompts the question: What are the other factors that contribute to a country's literacy rate? And how do countries measure literacy in the first place? </p>
